Therefore he decides to add some noise in his picture and just sends you the 2d shaped text file of the image. Now you have to denoise the image to see it. Surely you can use a simple filtering function to achieve this, but that sounds too boring for you. Instead, you want to convolve the filter and the image in a spatial domain."
